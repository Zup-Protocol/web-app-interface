# Zup Coding Style

This rule has everything that you must never or must do, in this application's code. Please follow it always, breaking any of these rules is strictly bad.

## Naming Folders & Files

The name of folders and files should be clear, always prefer clear names over short names because it seems better, for both, folders and files. E.g: Instead of `user/name.ts` for a file/class that will choose a name for the user, prefer to define what is the file for, so it should be `user/name-chooser.ts` it's easier to find & understand what is it about

## Comments

Junk comments are strictly prohibited, you should only comment abou things that can make not so much sense for anyone reading the code, then you explain why is it in that way. You must never comment things to make it easier to read, focus in making the code easy to read, so we don't even need comments to explain it
